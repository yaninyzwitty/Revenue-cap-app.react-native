            I read somewhere that family members are like planets; they may be
            distant but the force of love always pulls them together no matter
            what Not everyone in your life deserves your attention (like toxic
            people) so decide who those people are for you Do not do things that
            you hate When you fall you learn to rise. Itâ€™s part of growing up.
            You should speak the truth even if it makes you less popular Money
            cannot buy happiness but it can buy things that define happiness for
            you You should never stop learning since life never stops teaching
            You can't sit around and wait for things to fall in place, you have
            to assemble the puzzle yourself Smiling and laughing is good for
            your health so do it!
